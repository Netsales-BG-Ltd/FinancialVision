## Financial Vision
We are standing at the threshold of the information age, the financial services industry becomes the perfect playing field for machine learning technologies. We dedicate to develop applications of deep learning in finance, study the causal relationship between the data, and make progress on related computer science theory.

The project adopts deep learning models for financial data visualization. In financial trading, techniques like pattern recognition could advance the efficiency of strategic decisions. The professional traders could identify specific patterns among the candlestick charts with their long years of experience. At the same time, a convolutional neural network (CNN) in deep learning extracts spatial features from data. Compared to the model which designed to work on time series problem, the training process of the CNN model tends to be more similar to how human learns to study financial data.
